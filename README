  Analytics_Attachment.xlsx
  p2.py

  Analytics_Attachment.xlsx

    Contains the following three tabs:
      1) Division_Info: Divisions for the 2016-17 Season
      2) 2016_17_NBA_Scores: The game results for the 2016-17 NBA Regular Season
      3) NBA_Clinch_Dates: The elimination dates generated by p2.py

  p2.py

    Program that generates the elimination dates of the teams given the data
    in Analytics_Attachment.xlsx. The program will automatically extract the
    data from the excel spreadsheet and output the elimination dates to the same
    spreadsheet under the tab "NBA_Clinch_Dates". Note: The code does not always
    return the exact date that the teams are eliminated, but in cases where the
    exact date is not returned, the returned date is one game away from the
    actual date.

    Team.class

      

    Group.class



    Division.class

      Subclass of Group class. Unneccessary, but added for clarity of code.

    Conference.class

      Subclass of Group class. Contains a list of divisions within the
      conference. Overrides the rankTeams() method in group such that divisions
      within the conference are ranked first and then the teams are ranked.

How it works
-------------

  p2.py begins by parsing the data in the spreadsheet named
  'Analytics_Attachment.xlsx'. The program starts with the tab 'Division_Info'
  and uses the data to generate a list of Team objects, each of which contains
  key information about the team, including the team name, division, conference
  and elimination date. A list of Division objects is then generated from the
  list of Team objects and a list of Conference objects is then generated from
  the list of Team and the list of Division objects.
